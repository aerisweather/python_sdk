AerisWeatherPythonSDK
---------------------

The AerisWeather Python SDK allows a developer to quickly and easily add
weather content and functionality to their Python applications.

It utilizes the Aeris API backend for data loading and is built on
top of an object mapping system that efficiently loads requested
weather content into third-party Python applications, greatly
reducing the amount of code and development needed on the developer end.
