    "----  \n",
    " \n",
    "The AerisWeather Python SDK is a coding toolkit created to streamline integrating data from the [AerisWeather API](https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/) into Python applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the goal of the SDK is to make it easier to get weather data into your Python app. While working towards that goal, we also tried to make the SDK as \"Pythonic\" as possible, embracing some of our favorite core tenets of the [Zen of Python (PEP20)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id3):\n",
    "- Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "- Readability counts.\n",
    "- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  \n",

    "The full SDK containing the library, docs and demos is available for download from the project's GitHub page, or from the [Toolkits section](https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/) of the AerisWeather site.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want just the library, that's available all by itself on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/). Most likely though, you'll just want to install it via pip (see [Installation] in the Getting Started section below).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Python v3.6 or higher.\n",
    "- An active AerisWeather API subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don't have an active AerisWeather API client account?   \n",
    "Accessing the API data requires an active AerisWeather API subscription, and registration of your application or namespace. You can sign up for a free developer account at the [AerisWeather Sign Up page](https://www.aerisweather.com/signup/) to get your client ID and secret.*\n",

    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download the SDK  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already downloaded the SDK, see the [Downloads](#Downloads) section above and get the SDK and all it's contents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Demo File or Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the main SDK folder, you'll see the AerisWeatherPythonDemo folder. This folder contains:\n",

    "- aeris_demo.py\n",
    "- aeris_demo_notebook.ipynb  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first, aeris_demo.py is a simple Python file. The other is a Jupyter notebook. Both of these resources contain the same sample code, so you can choose to use either or both to learn more about how the aerisweather library works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that whichever path you choose to follow, you will need to [install the aerisweather package](#Install-the-aerisweather-Package) to the Python environment that supports that resource. We used PyCharm during the creation of the SDK, and used it to run the aeris_demo.py project. For the notebook, we configured the kernel to point to PyCharm's Python venv.  \n",

    "### Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The Aeris API supports data requests for many kinds of weather related data, each defined by an endpoint. Endpoints refer to the types of data to request, such as a place, observation, forecast or advisory, and will be the basis for any request made to the weather API. You can check out the full list of Aeris API endpoints on the [AerisWeather endpoints page](https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/reference/endpoints). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python SDK has implemented type hints to allow code completion in IDEs that support it. Code completion is available for all fully implemented endpoints. For new or custom endpoints that are not yet specifically implemented in the SDK, check out the section on [Custom Endpoint requests](#Custom-Endpoints).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples that follow, we are using two of the most popular endpoints of the Aeris API, Observations and Forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than the type of data (endpoint) itself, the next most important piece of info we need is the location, or place, to which that data pertains. You will find that in the API, location and place are sometimes used interchangeably.* For the purpose of the AerisWeather Python SDK, we will use the term \"location\". \n",
    "\n",
    "*Even in the requests for the \"Places\" endpoint - but we'll get to that later...  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to send a valid location to the API, we need either:\n",
    "- latitude **and** longitude\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "- city **and** state\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "- zip/postal code  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AerisWeather Python library, there a couple of ways to we can pass that location info to the API within a request.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The RequestLocation class\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"p=\" Parameter  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The RequestLocation\n",
    "\n",
    "The RequestLocation class is designed to be flexible enough to handle whatever location information you have, and give the most accurate location info to the API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python lib will take the most accurate source of data and pass that to the API. For instance, let's say you create a RequestLocation object, and set the latitude, longitude, city and state like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    loc = RequestLocation(city=\"minneapolis\", state=\"mn\", latitude=\"\", longitude=\"\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then we can use the RequestLocation object in an endpoint request, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    obs_list = aeris.observations(location=loc)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the lib builds the request for the API, it will use the lat and lon, since that's the most accurate of the info given.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to dig into the details of the RequestLocation class, you can check out the [code docs](https://www.aerisweather.com/docs/python/Aeris/classaerisweather_1_1requests_1_1_request_location_1_1_request_location.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The \"p\" Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you may want to use request Actions like \"closest\" to query the API for data that is closest to the requested place or location.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the p parameter, it takes the place of RequestLocation we discussed earlier. For example, we can create a request like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    obs_list = aeris.observations(action=RequestAction.OBSERVATIONS.CLOSEST, params={ParameterType.OBSERVATIONS.P: \"minnneapolis,mn\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Each request to the API, if successful, returns a list of endpoint appropriate response objects. Even if there is only one response result, it will be returned in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Observations request below returns a single response result. The response is returned as a list with one [ObservationsResponse](https://www.aerisweather.com/docs/python/Aeris/classaerisweather_1_1responses_1_1_observations_response_1_1_observations_response.html) object in it.\n",

    "### Optimizing API Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The Aeris API offers several request properties designed to improve response time and reduce the amount of data returned. Each Aeris API endpoint has a unique set of request properties for its specific data. To see the various request properties for a specific endpoint, check out the [corresponding endpoint docs](https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/reference/endpoints).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Aeris Python library, we have mapped each of these properties to their own class, and reduced the available options to only those that apply to each endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The endpoint request properties are broken down into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Request Action\n",
    "- Request Filter\n",
    "- Request Parameter\n",
    "- Request Field\n",
    "- Request Query\n",
    "- Request Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Aeris Python SDK, you can add these properties to your requests through the optional parameters passed to the request methods. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    obs_list = aeris.observations(action=RequestAction.OBSERVATIONS.CLOSEST, \n",
    "                                  filter_=[RequestFilter.OBSERVATIONS.ALL_STATIONS],\n",

    "\n",
    "The above Observations request is using an Action property of \"Closest\", a Filter property of \"All Stations\" and two Parameter options \"p\" and \"Fields\". This will provide a very specific set of Observations data for the location.  \n",

    "### Custom Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Aeris API continues to grow, new endpoints are added and new properties are added to existing ones. In some cases, the Aeris API may be updated ahead of the Python SDK may not yet support a new API endpoint. Or an endpoint may have been updated with new options. For cases like these, the Aeris Python library provides a special endpoint type named CUSTOM, and the CustomResponse class. In this section we'll show some examples of using these to make custom requests to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll request data for a valid endpoint, but one that isn't yet supported by the SDK. We do custom requests a little different, in that we need to define the EndpointType and set up an Endpoint object. We then pass that Endpoint object to the aerisweather.request() method and let it generate the request based on the endpoint object's properties.\n",

For more details on the API side of a batch request, check out the [Batch Request page](https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/getting-started/batch/).\n",

To make a batch request, we define an Endpoint object for each request we want to make, then send a list containing all of the endpoint objects to the aerisweather.batch_request() method.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Global Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the list of endpoints, we can also pass global properties to the batch_request() method. These properties will then be applied to each of the included endpoints, unless they override that particular property. For example, if we set up two endpoints like this:\n",
